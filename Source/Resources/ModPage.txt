Welcome to Fancy UI!, the tool that lets you customize <i>almost</i> anything in-game! This is an in-game guide on how to organise/set up a pack for icons or silhouettes. This mod is a culmination of a lot of ideas being thrown around for creativity's sake, resulting in this abomination (lol). Special thanks to MysticMismagius and Harry James Potter with the icon assets

<size=200%><b>Icon Pack Creation:</b></size>
<indent=4%>Step 1: Navigate to <b>[Your Town Of Salem 2 Installation Folder] > SalemModLoader > ModFolders > FancyUI > IconPacks</b> in your file explorer.
Step 2: Create a folder and name it something you want your icon pack to be.
Step 3: Navigate to the mod settings menu and select your icon pack in the <b>Selected Icon Pack</b> drop down setting.
Step 4: Go back to your file explorer and enter the folder for your icon pack. There should be some folders made for you.
Step 5: Populate the folders (only the lowest level ones, aka the roles/faction folders) with the images you want to replace, icons that don't have an image will be left unchanged.</indent>
