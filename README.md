# Icon Packs Mod

With this mod you can edit (most) renditions of game icons to your own liking! Paired with the Color Swapper and Text Editor mod, you now have a (mostly) fully customisable game experience!

# Pack Creation

- Step 1: Navigate to the mod menu for Icon Packs. Find the `Download Recommended Icon Packs` and change its value to `Vanilla`. Wait a while as the mod downloads the required icons. When the download is over, it should open a file explorer window. Exit the menu.
- Step 2: Create a folder and name it something you want your icon pack to be.
- Step 3: Navigate to the mod menu again and select your icon pack in the `Selected Icon Pack` drop down setting.
- Step 4: Go back to your file explorer and enter the folder for your icon pack. There should be some folders made for you.
- Step 5: Read the [folders](#folders) section.
- Step 6: Create your icon using a 256x256 image canvas (you can also do so by making it edit a vanilla icon and just delete the vanilla icon later if needed).
- Step 7: Place your image in the required folder and name the image as per the [image rules](#image-rules) section.
- Step 8: Change the value of `Selected Icon Pack` to `Vanilla` and then reselect your icon pack. Beware, there will be a lag spike as it loads everything. Note: Mentions may not load unless you restart the game.

-----------------------

# Image Rules

- Must be 256x256 pixels. **Ensure your images are of this size, because weird things happen if they aren't.**
- Must be png.
- Refer to the Vanilla icons on how to give the icons a base name.
- If the target folder is an easter egg folder and an icon for the image already exists, add `_Icon` after the image name followed by a number (typically the next one in line, starting from 0, like `_Icon0` and `_Icon1`).
- It is recommended you compress your images because a) it'll significantly lower load times b) not break the game in the rare few cases and c) makes your pack easily shareable. I recommend using [compressor.io](https://compressor.io).

-----------------------

# Folders

For a proper icon pack to function, you have to use at least one of `Base`, `TTBase` or `VIPBase` folder names.

`Base` is the folder that changes the icons all the time.\
`TTBase` is the folder where the icons in it will only appear when you are the Town Traitor.\
`VIPBase` is the folder where the icons within in will appear only when you are the VIP.\
The easter egg folders (`EasterEggs`, `TTEasterEggs` and `VIPEasterEggs`) can have as many icons as needed and will only appear with a small chance to replace the actual icons in the corresponding folders.

# Is Modding Bannable?

To quote the "Salem Mod Loader" [Discord](https://discord.gg/AdpRqzstfj).
> Use the mod at your own risk, while you have very low odds of being banned, you could be at risk if you openly state in games you are running a modded client as trials may guilty you under hacking even though the mod gives no advantages.

[Town of Salem Rules](https://www.blankmediagames.com/rules/)
> No Cheating – Gaining an unfair advantage over players through means other than normal gameplay. This includes but isn’t limited to using multiple accounts in the same game, sharing information outside the game, using a foreign language to communicate in a way that can’t be understood by the players in the current locale, and posting screenshots to prove something happened in game.

> We plan to have official mod support, but having a good base is important. A new player won't have a mod preinstalled.
