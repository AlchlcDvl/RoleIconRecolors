# Pack Creation

- Step 1: In the main menu, go to `Mod Actions` and click on the `Download Vanilla Icons`. Wait a while as the mod downloads the required icons. When the download is over, it should open a file explorer window. Close the game.
- Step 2: Create a folder and name it something you want your icon pack to be.
- Step 3: Start the game again and select your icon pack in the `Selected Icon Pack` drop down setting. Close the game.
- Step 4: Go back to your file explorer and enter the folder for your icon pack.
- Step 5: Read the [folders](#folders) section and create the folder you need for your icons.
- Step 6: Place your image in the required folder and rename it as per the [image rules](#image-rules).
- Step 7: Open the game.
- Step 8: Your icon pack should load on game start up, changing the value of `Selected Icon Pack` will make it load the new pack's icons. Beware, when changing icons, there will be a lag spike as it loads everything.

-----------------------

# Image Rules

- Must be 256x256 pixels.
- Must be png.
- Refer to the Vanilla icons on how to give the icons a base name.
- If the target folder is an easter egg folder and an icon for the image already exists, add `_Icon` after the image name followed by a number (typically the next one in line, starting from 1, like `_Icon1` and `_Icon2`).

-----------------------

# Folders

For a proper icon pack to function, you have to use at least one of `Base`, `TTBase` or `VIPBase` folder names.

`Base` is the folder that changes the icons all the time.\
`TTBase` is the folder where the icosn in it will only appear when you are the Town Traitor.\
`VIPBase` is the folder where the icons within in will appear only when you are the VIP.\
The easter egg folders can have as many icons as needed and will only appear with a small chance to replace the actual icons in the corresponding folders.

# Is Modding Bannable?

To quote the "Salem Mod Loader" [Discord](https://discord.gg/AdpRqzstfj).
> Use the mod at your own risk, while you have very low odds of being banned, you could be at risk if you openly state in games you are running a modded client as trials may guilty you under hacking even though the mod gives no advantages.

[Town of Salem Rules](https://www.blankmediagames.com/rules/)
> No Cheating – Gaining an unfair advantage over players through means other than normal gameplay. This includes but isn’t limited to using multiple accounts in the same game, sharing information outside the game, using a foreign language to communicate in a way that can’t be understood by the players in the current locale, and posting screenshots to prove something happened in game.

> We plan to have official mod support, but having a good base is important. A new player won't have a mod preinstalled.
